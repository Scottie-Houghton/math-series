### Links and Resources

### Setup
* .gitignore
* .venv


### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)
* python3 -m venv .venv
* source .venv/bin/activate
* pip install pytest

### Tests
* How do you run tests? - pytest
* Any tests of note? - Both the Fibonacci and Lucas functions have 3 tests each. One each for the first and second value, since those are what make them what they are. Then they each have a test for a value later in the sequence.
* Describe any tests that you did not complete, skipped, etc - I couldn't figure out the 3rd function or its test.c
